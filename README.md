# Python Remote Keylogger

## Overview

This Python-based remote keylogger is a versatile tool designed for ethical hacking, security testing, and educational purposes. It not only captures keystrokes but also includes features like microphone recording, email integration for remote access to logs, and cryptography for securing the collected data.

## Features

- **Keystroke Logging:** Captures all keystrokes, including special keys.
- **Microphone Recording:** Records audio through the system's microphone at specified intervals.
- **Email Integration:** Automatically sends logs and recorded audio to a specified email address.
- **Cryptography:** Encrypts collected data to ensure secure transmission and storage.
  - `generate_file`: Encrypts a given file using AES encryption.
  - `decrypt_file`: Decrypts a previously encrypted file.
- **Stealth Mode:** Runs silently in the background with minimal system impact.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/RiteshKumarNayak125/Python-Remote-Keylogger
cd python-remote-keylogger
```

## Configuration




## Usage

### Running the Keylogger

To start the keylogger:

```bash
python keylogger.py
```

### Encrypting and Decrypting Files

**Encrypt a file:**

```python
from cryptography import generate_file

generate_file("logfile.txt")
```

This will create an encrypted file named `logfile.txt.enc`.

**Decrypt a file:**

```python
from cryptography import decrypt_file

decrypt_file("logfile.txt.enc")
```

This will create a decrypted file named `decrypted_logfile.txt`.
